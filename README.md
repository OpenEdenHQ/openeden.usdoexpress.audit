## Dev

This Project uses Hardhat. It includes a contract, its tests, and a script that deploys the contract.

> Prerequisites: Node v18 LTS

### Installation

1. Install dependencies

   ```shell
   npm i
   ```

2. Copy ENV file

   ```shell
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Replace ENV variables with the values as needed

### Usage

Try running some of the following tasks:

Testing

```shell
npm run test
```

Coverage

```shell
npm run coverage
```

Linter

```shell
npm run lint
```

Running local node

```shell
npx hardhat node
```

Compile

```shell
npx hardhat compile
```

Deploying and contract verification

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network sepolia
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia <contract-address>
```

Help
